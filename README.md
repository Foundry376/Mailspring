**Hello! I'm one of the original authors of Nylas Mail and this is a significant fork of the app which completely replaces JavaScript mail sync with a C++ core built on Mailcore2. Unfortunately, it's not ready for use - check back soon!**

High level Goals:
---

- Replace JavaScript mail sync (client-sync package) and the Electron "worker window" with a new, high performance codebase written in C++ and based on Mailcore2. Make the Electron application just the UI layer.
  + One C++ process per email account.
  + C++ and JS communicate via the child process stdin/stdout streams.
  + JS application queues tasks *but has read-only access to the database.*
  + JS application should not install timers or wake /at all/ when idle. 0% battery impact when idle.
- Improve performance of the thread list and composer contenteditable.
- Make windows open faster by just having less code.
- Bring back mail rules.


Roadmap and Progress:

----------------

**Mailspring is an open-source mail client built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/).** It is designed to be extensible, so it's easy to create new experiences and workflows around email.
