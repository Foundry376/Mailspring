# Security

Mailspring takes the privacy of your data seriously. When you connect email accounts to the app, your email credentials are stored securely in your system keychain. Mailspring does not transmit, store or process your mail in the cloud. For more information about how we protect and handle your data, take a look at the [Privacy Policy](https://getmailspring.com/privacy-policy). We've written up a detailed [breakdown of the information](https://foundry376.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002704911-What-data-does-Mailspring-collect-when-I-use-the-product-) that Mailspring stores in the cloud, and we allow you to [delete it all](https://foundry376.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001994551-How-do-I-delete-my-Mailspring-ID-and-all-data-stored-on-Mailspring-servers-GDPR-) in compliance with GDPR.

When you set up the app you can also choose to skip "Mailspring ID" setup, which opts you out of our cloud features and prevents your data from being transmitted off your machine entirely.
