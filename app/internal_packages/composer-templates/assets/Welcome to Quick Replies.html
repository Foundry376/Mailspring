Hey, <code class="var empty">{{First Name}}</code>!
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Quick Replies plugin! Here you can create email templates with
<code class="var empty">{{variables}}</code> in double curly braces that you can quickly fill
before you send your email.
<br/>
<br/>
When you send your message, the highlighting is always removed so the recipient
never sees it.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
<br/>
