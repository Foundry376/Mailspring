<p>Hey, <span data-tvarname="first_name">First Name</span>!</p>
<p>Templates are pre-written emails with
<span data-tvarname="content">tagged variables</span> that make it easy to
reply quickly. Here's how it works:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<strong>Create a Template:</strong>
<ol>
<li>From Preferences > Templates, click <strong>'+'</strong> to compose a new template message.</li>
<li>Select text that you'd like to change each time you send the email (like the recipient's name
or the company they work at) and click the <strong>Tag</strong> icon in the toolbar above to
turn the text into a tagged variable.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Use the Template:</strong>
<ol>
<li>When composing an email, click the <strong>Templates</strong> icon at the bottom near the Send button. Choose the template from the list that appears.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Tab</strong> key to quickly jump between tagged variables and fill them in.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Pro Tip: When you send a templated email, the <span data-tvarname="highlighting">highlighting</span> is always removed so the recipient
never sees it.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Enjoy!
