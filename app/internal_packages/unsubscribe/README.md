![Unsubscribe: unsubscribe without leaving Nylas Mail](plugin.png)

Quickly unsubscribe from emails without leaving Nylas Mail. The unsubscribe plugin parses the `list-unsubscribe` header and the email body to look for the best way to unsubscribe. If an unsubscribe email address can be found, the plugin will send one in the background on your behalf. If only a browser link is found, either a mini Nylas Mail browser window will open or you will be redirected to your default browser based on your preferences and certain exceptions.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> when viewing an email. This shortcut can be changed in the preference panel (`Nylas->Preferences->Unsubscribe`).

## Reporting Bugs

- **Feature Requests or Bug Reports**: Submit them through the [issues](issues) pane.
