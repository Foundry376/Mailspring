# Step 4: Review & Finalize

**Progress: Step 4 of 4** - Final Step

## RULES:

- MUST NOT skip steps.
- MUST NOT optimize sequence.
- MUST follow exact instructions.
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## CONTEXT:

- Requires `{wipFile}` from Step 3. 
- MUST present COMPLETE spec content. Iterate until user is satisfied.
- **Criteria**: The spec MUST meet the **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** standard defined in `workflow.md`.

## SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Load and Present Complete Spec

**Read `{wipFile}` completely and extract `slug` from frontmatter for later use.**

**Present to user:**

"Here's your complete tech-spec. Please review:"

[Display the complete spec content - all sections]

"**Quick Summary:**

- {task_count} tasks to implement
- {ac_count} acceptance criteria to verify
- {files_count} files to modify"

**Present review menu:**

Display: "**Select:** [C] Continue [E] Edit [Q] Questions [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode"

**HALT and wait for user selection.**

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Proceed to Section 3 (Finalize the Spec)
- IF E: Proceed to Section 2 (Handle Review Feedback), then return here and redisplay menu
- IF Q: Answer questions, then redisplay this menu
- IF A: Read fully and follow: `{advanced_elicitation}` with current spec content, process enhanced insights, ask user "Accept improvements? (y/n)", if yes update spec then redisplay menu, if no keep original then redisplay menu
- IF P: Read fully and follow: `{party_mode_exec}` with current spec content, process collaborative insights, ask user "Accept changes? (y/n)", if yes update spec then redisplay menu, if no keep original then redisplay menu
- IF Any other comments or queries: respond helpfully then redisplay menu

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to finalize when user selects 'C'
- After other menu items execution, return to this menu

### 2. Handle Review Feedback

a) **If user requests changes:**

- Make the requested edits to `{wipFile}`
- Re-present the affected sections
- Ask if there are more changes
- Loop until user is satisfied

b) **If the spec does NOT meet the "Ready for Development" standard:**

- Point out the missing/weak sections (e.g., non-actionable tasks, missing ACs).
- Propose specific improvements to reach the standard.
- Make the edits once the user agrees.

c) **If user has questions:**

- Answer questions about the spec
- Clarify any confusing sections
- Make clarifying edits if needed

### 3. Finalize the Spec

**When user confirms the spec is good AND it meets the "Ready for Development" standard:**

a) Update `{wipFile}` frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   # ... existing values ...
   status: 'ready-for-dev'
   stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ---
   ```

b) **Rename WIP file to final filename:**
   - Using the `slug` extracted in Section 1
   - Rename `{wipFile}` → `{implementation_artifacts}/tech-spec-{slug}.md`
   - Store this as `finalFile` for use in menus below

### 4. Present Final Menu

a) **Display completion message and menu:**

```
**Tech-Spec Complete!**

Saved to: {finalFile}

---

**Next Steps:**

[A] Advanced Elicitation - refine further
[R] Adversarial Review - critique of the spec (highly recommended)
[B] Begin Development - start implementing now (not recommended)
[D] Done - exit workflow
[P] Party Mode - get expert feedback before dev

---

Once you are fully satisfied with the spec (ideally after **Adversarial Review** and maybe a few rounds of **Advanced Elicitation**), it is recommended to run implementation in a FRESH CONTEXT for best results.

Copy this prompt to start dev:

\`\`\`
quick-dev {finalFile}
\`\`\`

This ensures the dev agent has clean context focused solely on implementation.
```

b) **HALT and wait for user selection.**

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF A: Read fully and follow: `{advanced_elicitation}` with current spec content, process enhanced insights, ask user "Accept improvements? (y/n)", if yes update spec then redisplay menu, if no keep original then redisplay menu
- IF B: Read the entire workflow file at `{quick_dev_workflow}` and follow the instructions with the final spec file (warn: fresh context is better)
- IF D: Exit workflow - display final confirmation and path to spec
- IF P: Read fully and follow: `{party_mode_exec}` with current spec content, process collaborative insights, ask user "Accept changes? (y/n)", if yes update spec then redisplay menu, if no keep original then redisplay menu
- IF R: Execute Adversarial Review (see below)
- IF Any other comments or queries: respond helpfully then redisplay menu

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- After A, P, or R execution, return to this menu

#### Adversarial Review [R] Process:

1. **Invoke Adversarial Review Task**:
       > With `{finalFile}` constructed, invoke the review task. If possible, use information asymmetry: run this task, and only it, in a separate subagent or process with read access to the project, but no context except the `{finalFile}`.
       <invoke-task>Review {finalFile} using {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/review-adversarial-general.xml</invoke-task>
       > **Platform fallback:** If task invocation not available, load the task file and follow its instructions inline, passing `{finalFile}` as the content.
       > The task should: review `{finalFile}` and return a list of findings.

    2. **Process Findings**:
       > Capture the findings from the task output.
       > **If zero findings:** HALT - this is suspicious. Re-analyze or request user guidance.
       > Evaluate severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and validity (real, noise, undecided).
       > DO NOT exclude findings based on severity or validity unless explicitly asked to do so.
       > Order findings by severity.
       > Number the ordered findings (F1, F2, F3, etc.).
       > If TodoWrite or similar tool is available, turn each finding into a TODO, include ID, severity, validity, and description in the TODO; otherwise present findings as a table with columns: ID, Severity, Validity, Description

    3. Return here and redisplay menu.

### 5. Exit Workflow

**When user selects [D]:**

"**All done!** Your tech-spec is ready at:

`{finalFile}`

When you're ready to implement, run:

```
quick-dev {finalFile}
```

Ship it!"

---

## REQUIRED OUTPUTS:

- MUST update status to 'ready-for-dev'.
- MUST rename file to `tech-spec-{slug}.md`.
- MUST provide clear next-step guidance and recommend fresh context for dev.

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

- [ ] Complete spec presented for review.
- [ ] Requested changes implemented.
- [ ] Spec verified against **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** standard.
- [ ] `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]` set and file renamed.
