# Technical Research Step 2: Technology Stack Analysis

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on languages, frameworks, tools, and platforms
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📝 WRITE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after technology stack content generation
- 📝 WRITE TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS TO DOCUMENT IMMEDIATELY
- 💾 ONLY proceed when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from step-01 are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion
- Focus on languages, frameworks, tools, and platforms
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct technology stack analysis focusing on languages, frameworks, tools, and platforms. Search the web to verify and supplement current facts.

## TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Technology Stack Analysis

**UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS**: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different technology stack areas simultaneously and thoroughly.

Start with technology stack research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **technology stack analysis** for **{{research_topic}}** to understand the technology landscape.

**Technology Stack Focus:**

- Programming languages and their evolution
- Development frameworks and libraries
- Database and storage technologies
- Development tools and platforms
- Cloud infrastructure and deployment platforms

**Let me search for current technology stack insights.**"

### 2. Parallel Technology Stack Research Execution

**Execute multiple web searches simultaneously:**

Search the web: "{{research_topic}} programming languages frameworks"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} development tools platforms"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} database storage technologies"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} cloud infrastructure platforms"

**Analysis approach:**

- Look for recent technology trend reports and developer surveys
- Search for technology documentation and best practices
- Research open-source projects and their technology choices
- Analyze technology adoption patterns and migration trends
- Study platform and tool evolution in the domain

### 3. Analyze and Aggregate Results

**Collect and analyze findings from all parallel searches:**

"After executing comprehensive parallel web searches, let me analyze and aggregate technology stack findings:

**Research Coverage:**

- Programming languages and frameworks analysis
- Development tools and platforms evaluation
- Database and storage technologies assessment
- Cloud infrastructure and deployment platform analysis

**Cross-Technology Analysis:**
[Identify patterns connecting language choices, frameworks, and platform decisions]

**Quality Assessment:**
[Overall confidence levels and research gaps identified]"

### 4. Generate Technology Stack Content

**WRITE IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT**

Prepare technology stack analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown

```

### 5. Present Analysis and Continue Option

**Show analysis and present continue option:**

"I've completed **technology stack analysis** of the technology landscape for {{research_topic}}.

**Key Technology Stack Findings:**

- Programming languages and frameworks thoroughly analyzed
- Database and storage technologies evaluated
- Development tools and platforms documented
- Cloud infrastructure and deployment options mapped
- Technology adoption trends identified

**Ready to proceed to integration patterns analysis?**
[C] Continue - Save this to document and proceed to integration patterns

### 6. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- **CONTENT ALREADY WRITTEN TO DOCUMENT**
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]`
- Load: `./step-03-integration-patterns.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

Content is already written to document when generated in step 4. No additional append needed.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Programming languages and frameworks thoroughly analyzed
✅ Database and storage technologies evaluated
✅ Development tools and platforms documented
✅ Cloud infrastructure and deployment options mapped
✅ Technology adoption trends identified
✅ Content written immediately to document
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Proper routing to next step (integration patterns)
✅ Research goals alignment maintained

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current facts

❌ Missing critical programming languages or frameworks
❌ Incomplete database and storage technology analysis
❌ Not identifying development tools and platforms
❌ Not writing content immediately to document
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Not routing to integration patterns step

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## TECHNOLOGY STACK RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Research technology trend reports and developer surveys
- Use technology documentation and best practices guides
- Analyze open-source projects and their technology choices
- Study technology adoption patterns and migration trends
- Focus on current technology data
- Present conflicting information when sources disagree
- Apply confidence levels appropriately

## TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS STANDARDS:

- Always cite URLs for web search results
- Use authoritative technology research sources
- Note data currency and potential limitations
- Present multiple perspectives when sources conflict
- Apply confidence levels to uncertain data
- Focus on actionable technology insights

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C', load `./step-03-integration-patterns.md` to analyze APIs, communication protocols, and system interoperability for {{research_topic}}.

Remember: Always write research content to document immediately and emphasize current technology data with rigorous source verification!
