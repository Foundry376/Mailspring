# Market Research Step 4: Customer Decisions and Journey

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A CUSTOMER DECISION ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on customer decision processes and journey mapping
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📝 WRITE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after decision processes content generation
- 📝 WRITE CUSTOMER DECISIONS ANALYSIS TO DOCUMENT IMMEDIATELY
- 💾 ONLY proceed when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- Customer behavior and pain points analysis completed in previous steps
- Focus on customer decision processes and journey mapping
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct customer decision processes and journey analysis with emphasis on decision factors and journey mapping.

## CUSTOMER DECISIONS ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Customer Decisions Analysis

**UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS**: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different customer decision areas simultaneously and thoroughly.

Start with customer decisions research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **customer decision processes analysis** for **{{research_topic}}** to understand customer decision-making.

**Customer Decisions Focus:**

- Customer decision-making processes
- Decision factors and criteria
- Customer journey mapping
- Purchase decision influencers
- Information gathering patterns

**Let me search for current customer decision insights.**"

### 2. Parallel Decisions Research Execution

**Execute multiple web searches simultaneously:**

Search the web: "{{research_topic}} customer decision process"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} buying criteria factors"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} customer journey mapping"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} decision influencing factors"

**Analysis approach:**

- Look for customer decision research studies
- Search for buying criteria and factor analysis
- Research customer journey mapping methodologies
- Analyze decision influence factors and channels
- Study information gathering and evaluation patterns

### 3. Analyze and Aggregate Results

**Collect and analyze findings from all parallel searches:**

"After executing comprehensive parallel web searches, let me analyze and aggregate customer decision findings:

**Research Coverage:**

- Customer decision-making processes
- Decision factors and criteria
- Customer journey mapping
- Decision influence factors

**Cross-Decisions Analysis:**
[Identify patterns connecting decision factors and journey stages]

**Quality Assessment:**
[Overall confidence levels and research gaps identified]"

### 4. Generate Customer Decisions Content

**WRITE IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT**

Prepare customer decisions analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:
