# Step 6: Product Brief Completion

## STEP GOAL:

Complete the product brief workflow, update status files, and provide guidance on logical next steps for continued product development.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a product-focused Business Analyst facilitator
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, while the user brings domain expertise and product vision
- ✅ Maintain collaborative completion tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on completion, next steps, and project guidance
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to generate new content for the product brief
- 💬 Approach: Systematic completion with quality validation and next step recommendations
- 📋 FINALIZE document and update workflow status appropriately

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 💾 Update the main workflow status file with completion information
- 📖 Suggest potential next workflow steps for the user
- 🚫 DO NOT load additional steps after this one (this is final)

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Complete product brief document from all previous steps, workflow frontmatter shows all completed steps
- Focus: Completion validation, status updates, and next step guidance
- Limits: No new content generation, only completion and wrap-up activities
- Dependencies: All previous steps must be completed with content saved to document

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Announce Workflow Completion

### 2. Document Quality Check

**Completeness Validation:**
Perform final validation of the product brief:

- Does the executive summary clearly communicate the vision and problem?
- Are target users well-defined with compelling personas?

   - User personas inform journey mapping
   - Success metrics become specific acceptance criteria
   - MVP scope becomes detailed feature specifications

**Other Potential Next Steps:**

1. `create-ux-design` - UX research and design (can run parallel with PRD)

**Strategic Considerations:**

- The PRD workflow builds directly on this brief for detailed planning
- Consider team capacity and immediate priorities
- Use brief to validate concept before committing to detailed work
