# Step 1b: Workflow Continuation Handler

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between architectural peers
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on understanding current state and getting user confirmation
- 🚪 HANDLE workflow resumption smoothly and transparently
- ⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - AI development speed has fundamentally changed
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 📖 Read existing document completely to understand current state
- 💾 Update frontmatter to reflect continuation
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed to next step without user confirmation

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Existing document and frontmatter are available
- Input documents already loaded should be in frontmatter `inputDocuments`
- Steps already completed are in `stepsCompleted` array
- Focus on understanding where we left off

## YOUR TASK:

Handle workflow continuation by analyzing existing work and guiding the user to resume at the appropriate step.

## CONTINUATION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Analyze Current Document State

Read the existing architecture document completely and analyze:

**Frontmatter Analysis:**

- `stepsCompleted`: What steps have been done
- `inputDocuments`: What documents were loaded
- `lastStep`: Last step that was executed
- `project_name`, `user_name`, `date`: Basic context

**Content Analysis:**

- What sections exist in the document
- What architectural decisions have been made
- What appears incomplete or in progress
- Any TODOs or placeholders remaining

### 2. Present Continuation Summary

Show the user their current progress:

"Welcome back {{user_name}}! I found your Architecture work for {{project_name}}.

**Current Progress:**

- Steps completed: {{stepsCompleted list}}
- Last step worked on: Step {{lastStep}}
- Input documents loaded: {{number of inputDocuments}} files

**Document Sections Found:**
{list all H2/H3 sections found in the document}

{if_incomplete_sections}
**Incomplete Areas:**

- {areas that appear incomplete or have placeholders}
  {/if_incomplete_sections}

**What would you like to do?**
[R] Resume from where we left off
[C] Continue to next logical step
[O] Overview of all remaining steps
[X] Start over (will overwrite existing work)
"

### 3. Handle User Choice

#### If 'R' (Resume from where we left off):

- Identify the next step based on `stepsCompleted`
- Load the appropriate step file to continue
- Example: If `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`, load `step-04-decisions.md`

#### If 'C' (Continue to next logical step):

- Analyze the document content to determine logical next step
- May need to review content quality and completeness
- If content seems complete for current step, advance to next
- If content seems incomplete, suggest staying on current step

#### If 'O' (Overview of all remaining steps):

- Provide brief description of all remaining steps
- Let user choose which step to work on
- Don't assume sequential progression is always best

#### If 'X' (Start over):

- Confirm: "This will delete all existing architectural decisions. Are you sure? (y/n)"
- If confirmed: Delete existing document and return to step-01-init.md
- If not confirmed: Return to continuation menu

### 4. Navigate to Selected Step

After user makes choice:

**Load the selected step file:**

- Update frontmatter `lastStep` to reflect current navigation
- Execute the selected step file
- Let that step handle the detailed continuation logic

**State Preservation:**

- Maintain all existing content in the document
- Keep `stepsCompleted` accurate
- Track the resumption in workflow status

### 5. Special Continuation Cases

#### If `stepsCompleted` is empty but document has content:

- This suggests an interrupted workflow
- Ask user: "I see the document has content but no steps are marked as complete. Should I analyze what's here and set the appropriate step status?"

#### If document appears corrupted or incomplete:

- Ask user: "The document seems incomplete. Would you like me to try to recover what's here, or would you prefer to start fresh?"

#### If document is complete but workflow not marked as done:

- Ask user: "The architecture looks complete! Should I mark this workflow as finished, or is there more you'd like to work on?"

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Existing document state properly analyzed and understood
✅ User presented with clear continuation options
✅ User choice handled appropriately and transparently
✅ Workflow state preserved and updated correctly
✅ Navigation to appropriate step handled smoothly

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not reading the complete existing document before making suggestions
❌ Losing track of what steps were actually completed
❌ Automatically proceeding without user confirmation of next steps
❌ Not checking for incomplete or placeholder content
❌ Losing existing document content during resumption

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects their continuation option, load the appropriate step file based on their choice. The step file will handle the detailed work from that point forward.

Remember: The goal is smooth, transparent resumption that respects the work already done while giving the user control over how to proceed.
