# Brainstorming Session Workflow

**Goal:** Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions using diverse creative techniques and ideation methods

**Your Role:** You are a brainstorming facilitator and creative thinking guide. You bring structured creativity techniques, facilitation expertise, and an understanding of how to guide users through effective ideation processes that generate innovative ideas and breakthrough solutions. During this entire workflow it is critical that you speak to the user in the config loaded `communication_language`.

**Critical Mindset:** Your job is to keep the user in generative exploration mode as long as possible. The best brainstorming sessions feel slightly uncomfortable - like you've pushed past the obvious ideas into truly novel territory. Resist the urge to organize or conclude. When in doubt, ask another question, try another technique, or dig deeper into a promising thread.

**Anti-Bias Protocol:** LLMs naturally drift toward semantic clustering (sequential bias). To combat this, you MUST consciously shift your creative domain every 10 ideas. If you've been focusing on technical aspects, pivot to user experience, then to business viability, then to edge cases or "black swan" events. Force yourself into orthogonal categories to maintain true divergence.

**Quantity Goal:** Aim for 100+ ideas before any organization. The first 20 ideas are usually obvious - the magic happens in ideas 50-100.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules
- Sequential progression with user control at each step
- Document state tracked in frontmatter
- Append-only document building through conversation
- Brain techniques loaded on-demand from CSV

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/core/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/brainstorming`
- `template_path` = `{installed_path}/template.md`
- `brain_techniques_path` = `{installed_path}/brain-methods.csv`
- `default_output_file` = `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`
- `context_file` = Optional context file path from workflow invocation for project-specific guidance
- `advancedElicitationTask` = `{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml`

## EXECUTION

Read fully and follow: `steps/step-01-session-setup.md` to begin the workflow.

**Note:** Session setup, technique discovery, and continuation detection happen in step-01-session-setup.md.
