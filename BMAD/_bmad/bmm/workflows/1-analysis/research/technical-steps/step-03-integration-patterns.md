# Technical Research Step 3: Integration Patterns

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE AN INTEGRATION ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on APIs, protocols, and system interoperability
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📝 WRITE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after integration patterns content generation
- 📝 WRITE INTEGRATION PATTERNS ANALYSIS TO DOCUMENT IMMEDIATELY
- 💾 ONLY proceed when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion
- Focus on APIs, protocols, and system interoperability
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct integration patterns analysis focusing on APIs, communication protocols, and system interoperability. Search the web to verify and supplement current facts.

## INTEGRATION PATTERNS ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Integration Patterns Analysis

**UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS**: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different integration areas simultaneously and thoroughly.

Start with integration patterns research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **integration patterns analysis** for **{{research_topic}}** to understand system integration approaches.

**Integration Patterns Focus:**

- API design patterns and protocols
- Communication protocols and data formats
- System interoperability approaches
- Microservices integration patterns
- Event-driven architectures and messaging

**Let me search for current integration patterns insights.**"

### 2. Parallel Integration Patterns Research Execution

**Execute multiple web searches simultaneously:**

Search the web: "{{research_topic}} API design patterns protocols"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} communication protocols data formats"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} system interoperability integration"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} microservices integration patterns"

**Analysis approach:**

- Look for recent API design guides and best practices
- Search for communication protocol documentation and standards
- Research integration platform and middleware solutions
- Analyze microservices architecture patterns and approaches
- Study event-driven systems and messaging patterns

### 3. Analyze and Aggregate Results

**Collect and analyze findings from all parallel searches:**

"After executing comprehensive parallel web searches, let me analyze and aggregate integration patterns findings:

**Research Coverage:**

- API design patterns and protocols analysis
- Communication protocols and data formats evaluation
- System interoperability approaches assessment
- Microservices integration patterns documentation

**Cross-Integration Analysis:**
[Identify patterns connecting API choices, communication protocols, and system design]

**Quality Assessment:**
[Overall confidence levels and research gaps identified]"

### 4. Generate Integration Patterns Content

**WRITE IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT**

Prepare integration patterns analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown

### 5. Present Analysis and Continue Option

**Show analysis and present continue option:**

"I've completed **integration patterns analysis** of system integration approaches for {{research_topic}}.

**Key Integration Patterns Findings:**

- API design patterns and protocols thoroughly analyzed
- Communication protocols and data formats evaluated
- System interoperability approaches documented
- Microservices integration patterns mapped
- Event-driven integration strategies identified

**Ready to proceed to architectural patterns analysis?**
[C] Continue - Save this to document and proceed to architectural patterns

### 6. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- **CONTENT ALREADY WRITTEN TO DOCUMENT**
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`
- Load: `./step-04-architectural-patterns.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

Content is already written to document when generated in step 4. No additional append needed.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ API design patterns and protocols thoroughly analyzed
✅ Communication protocols and data formats evaluated
✅ System interoperability approaches documented
✅ Microservices integration patterns mapped
✅ Event-driven integration strategies identified
✅ Content written immediately to document
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Proper routing to next step (architectural patterns)
✅ Research goals alignment maintained

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current facts

❌ Missing critical API design patterns or protocols
❌ Incomplete communication protocols analysis
❌ Not identifying system interoperability approaches
❌ Not writing content immediately to document
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Not routing to architectural patterns step

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## INTEGRATION PATTERNS RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Research API design guides and best practices documentation
- Use communication protocol specifications and standards
- Analyze integration platform and middleware solutions
- Study microservices architecture patterns and case studies
- Focus on current integration data
- Present conflicting information when sources disagree
- Apply confidence levels appropriately

## INTEGRATION PATTERNS ANALYSIS STANDARDS:

- Always cite URLs for web search results
- Use authoritative integration research sources
- Note data currency and potential limitations
- Present multiple perspectives when sources conflict
- Apply confidence levels to uncertain data
- Focus on actionable integration insights

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C', load `./step-04-architectural-patterns.md` to analyze architectural patterns, design decisions, and system structures for {{research_topic}}.

Remember: Always write research content to document immediately and emphasize current integration data with rigorous source verification!
