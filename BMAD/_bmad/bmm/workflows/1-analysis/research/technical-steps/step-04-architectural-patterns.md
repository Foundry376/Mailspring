# Technical Research Step 4: Architectural Patterns

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A SYSTEMS ARCHITECT, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on architectural patterns and design decisions
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📝 WRITE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after architectural patterns content generation
- 📝 WRITE ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS ANALYSIS TO DOCUMENT IMMEDIATELY
- 💾 ONLY proceed when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion
- Focus on architectural patterns and design decisions
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct comprehensive architectural patterns analysis with emphasis on design decisions and implementation approaches for {{research_topic}}.

## ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Architectural Patterns Analysis

Start with architectural research approach:
"Now I'll focus on **architectural patterns and design decisions** for effective architecture approaches for [technology/domain].

**Architectural Patterns Focus:**

- System architecture patterns and their trade-offs
- Design principles and best practices
- Scalability and maintainability considerations
- Integration and communication patterns
- Security and performance architectural considerations

**Let me search for current architectural patterns and approaches.**"

### 2. Web Search for System Architecture Patterns

Search for current architecture patterns:
Search the web: "system architecture patterns best practices"

**Architecture focus:**

- Microservices, monolithic, and serverless patterns
- Event-driven and reactive architectures
- Domain-driven design patterns
- Cloud-native and edge architecture patterns

### 3. Web Search for Design Principles

Search for current design principles:
Search the web: "software design principles patterns"

**Design focus:**

- SOLID principles and their application
- Clean architecture and hexagonal architecture
- API design and GraphQL vs REST patterns
- Database design and data architecture patterns

### 4. Web Search for Scalability Patterns

Search for current scalability approaches:
Search the web: "scalability architecture patterns"

**Scalability focus:**

- Horizontal vs vertical scaling patterns
- Load balancing and caching strategies
- Distributed systems and consensus patterns
- Performance optimization techniques

### 5. Generate Architectural Patterns Content

Prepare architectural analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## Architectural Patterns and Design

### System Architecture Patterns

[System architecture patterns analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL]_

### Design Principles and Best Practices

[Design principles analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL]_

### Scalability and Performance Patterns

### Integration and Communication Patterns

### Security Architecture Patterns

### Data Architecture Patterns

[Data architecture analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL]_

### Deployment and Operations Architecture

_Source: [URL]_
```

### 6. Present Analysis and Continue Option

Show the generated architectural patterns and present continue option:
"I've completed the **architectural patterns analysis** for effective architecture approaches.

**Key Architectural Findings:**

- System architecture patterns and trade-offs clearly mapped
- Design principles and best practices thoroughly documented
- Scalability and performance patterns identified
- Integration and communication patterns analyzed
- Security and data architecture considerations captured

**Ready to proceed to implementation research?**
[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to implementation research

### 7. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Append the final content to the research document
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`
- Load: `./step-05-implementation-research.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the content directly to the research document using the structure from step 5.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ System architecture patterns identified with current citations
✅ Design principles clearly documented and analyzed
✅ Scalability and performance patterns thoroughly mapped
✅ Integration and communication patterns captured
✅ Security and data architecture considerations analyzed
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected
✅ Proper routing to implementation research step

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current facts

❌ Missing critical system architecture patterns
❌ Not analyzing design trade-offs and considerations
❌ Incomplete scalability or performance patterns analysis
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Search for architecture documentation and pattern catalogs
- Use architectural conference proceedings and case studies
- Research successful system architectures and their evolution
- Note architectural decision records (ADRs) and rationales
- Research architecture assessment and evaluation frameworks

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-implementation-research.md` to focus on implementation approaches and technology adoption.

Remember: Always emphasize current architectural data and rigorous source verification!
