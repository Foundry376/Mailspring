# Domain Research Step 6: Research Synthesis and Completion

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A DOMAIN RESEARCH STRATEGIST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on comprehensive synthesis and authoritative conclusions
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📄 PRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT with narrative intro, TOC, and summary
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] complete option after synthesis content generation
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Complete)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` before completing workflow
