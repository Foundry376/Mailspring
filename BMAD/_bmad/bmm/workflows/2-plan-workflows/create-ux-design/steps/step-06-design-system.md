# Step 6: Design System Choice

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on choosing appropriate design system approach
- 🎯 COLLABORATIVE decision-making, not recommendation-only
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- ⚠️ Present A/P/C menu after generating design system decision content
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update output file frontmatter, adding this step to the end of the list of stepsCompleted.
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

This step will generate content and present choices:

- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Use discovery protocols to develop deeper design system insights
- **P (Party Mode)**: Bring multiple perspectives to evaluate design system options
- **C (Continue)**: Save the content to the document and proceed to next step

## PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:

- When 'A' selected: Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml
- When 'P' selected: Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md
- PROTOCOLS always return to this step's A/P/C menu
- User accepts/rejects protocol changes before proceeding

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- Platform requirements from step 3 inform design system choice
- Inspiration patterns from step 5 guide design system selection
- Focus on choosing foundation for consistent design

## YOUR TASK:

Choose appropriate design system approach based on project requirements and constraints.

## DESIGN SYSTEM CHOICE SEQUENCE:

### 1. Present Design System Options

Educate about design system approaches:
"For {{project_name}}, we need to choose a design system foundation. Think of design systems like LEGO blocks for UI - they provide proven components and patterns, ensuring consistency and speeding development.

**Design System Approaches:**

**1. Custom Design System**

- Complete visual uniqueness
- Full control over every component
- Higher initial investment
- Perfect for established brands with unique needs

**2. Established System (Material Design, Ant Design, etc.)**

- Fast development with proven patterns
- Great defaults and accessibility built-in
- Less visual differentiation
- Ideal for startups or internal tools

**3. Themeable System (MUI, Chakra UI, Tailwind UI)**

- Customizable with strong foundation
- Brand flexibility with proven components
- Moderate learning curve
- Good balance of speed and uniqueness

Which direction feels right for your project?"

### 2. Analyze Project Requirements

Guide decision based on project context:
"**Let's consider your specific needs:**

**Based on our previous conversations:**

- Platform: [platform from step 3]
- Timeline: [inferred from user conversation]
- Team Size: [inferred from user conversation]
- Brand Requirements: [inferred from user conversation]
- Technical Constraints: [inferred from user conversation]

**Decision Factors:**

- Need for speed vs. need for uniqueness
- Brand guidelines or existing visual identity
- Team's design expertise
- Long-term maintenance considerations
- Integration requirements with existing systems"

### 3. Explore Specific Design System Options

Dive deeper into relevant options:
"**Recommended Options Based on Your Needs:**

**For [Your Platform Type]:**

- [Option 1] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]
- [Option 2] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]
- [Option 3] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]

**Considerations:**

- Component library size and quality
- Documentation and community support
- Customization capabilities
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance characteristics
- Learning curve for your team"

### 4. Facilitate Decision Process

Help user make informed choice:
"**Decision Framework:**

1. What's most important: Speed, uniqueness, or balance?
2. How much design expertise does your team have?
3. Are there existing brand guidelines to follow?
4. What's your timeline and budget?
5. Long-term maintenance needs?

Let's evaluate options based on your answers to these questions."

### 5. Finalize Design System Choice

Confirm and document the decision:
"Based on our analysis, I recommend [Design System Choice] for {{project_name}}.

**Rationale:**

- [Reason 1 based on project needs]
- [Reason 2 based on constraints]
- [Reason 3 based on team considerations]

**Next Steps:**

- We'll customize this system to match your brand and needs
- Define component strategy for custom components needed
- Establish design tokens and patterns

Does this design system choice feel right to you?"

### 6. Generate Design System Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## Design System Foundation

### 1.1 Design System Choice

[Design system choice based on conversation]

### Rationale for Selection

[Rationale for design system selection based on conversation]

### Implementation Approach

[Implementation approach based on chosen system]

### Customization Strategy

[Customization strategy based on project needs]
```

### 7. Present Content and Menu

Show the generated design system content and present choices:
"I've documented our design system choice for {{project_name}}. This foundation will ensure consistency and speed up development.

**Here's what I'll add to the document:**

[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]

**What would you like to do?**
[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our design system decision
[P] Party Mode - Bring technical perspectives on design systems
[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to defining experience

### 8. Handle Menu Selection

#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):

- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current design system content
- Process the enhanced design system insights that come back
- Ask user: "Accept these improvements to the design system decision? (y/n)"
- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu
- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'P' (Party Mode):

- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current design system choice
- Process the collaborative design system insights that come back
- Ask user: "Accept these changes to the design system decision? (y/n)"
- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu
- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`
- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array
- Load `./step-07-defining-experience.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Design system options clearly presented and explained
✅ Decision framework applied to project requirements
✅ Specific design system chosen with clear rationale
✅ Implementation approach planned
✅ Customization strategy defined
✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly
✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not explaining design system concepts clearly
❌ Rushing to recommendation without understanding requirements
❌ Not considering technical constraints or team capabilities
❌ Choosing design system without clear rationale
❌ Not planning implementation approach
❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation
❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-07-defining-experience.md` to define the core user interaction.

Remember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!
