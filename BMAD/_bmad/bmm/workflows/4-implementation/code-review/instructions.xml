    <!-- Code Quality Deep Dive -->
    <action>For EACH file in comprehensive review list:
      1. **Security**: Look for injection risks, missing validation, auth issues
      2. **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, missing caching
      3. **Error Handling**: Missing try/catch, poor error messages
      4. **Code Quality**: Complex functions, magic numbers, poor naming
      5. **Test Quality**: Are tests real assertions or placeholders?

      ## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES
      - Tasks marked [x] but not actually implemented
      - Acceptance Criteria not implemented
      - Story claims files changed but no git evidence
      - Security vulnerabilities

      ## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES
      - Files changed but not documented in story File List
      - Uncommitted changes not tracked
      - Performance problems
      - Poor test coverage/quality
      - Code maintainability issues

      ## 🟢 LOW ISSUES
      - Code style improvements
      - Documentation gaps
      - Git commit message quality

    <ask>What should I do with these issues?

      2. **Create action items** - Add to story Tasks/Subtasks for later
