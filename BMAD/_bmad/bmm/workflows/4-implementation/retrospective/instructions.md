# Retrospective - Epic Completion Review Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/retrospective/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed - what once took teams weeks/months can now be done by one person in hours. DO NOT give ANY time estimates whatsoever.</critical>

<critical>
  DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Retrospective analysis. Concise insights, lessons learned, action items. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not retrospective content.

FACILITATION NOTES:

- Scrum Master facilitates this retrospective
- Psychological safety is paramount - NO BLAME
- Focus on systems, processes, and learning
- Everyone contributes with specific examples preferred
- Action items must be achievable with clear ownership
- Two-part format: (1) Epic Review + (2) Next Epic Preparation

PARTY MODE PROTOCOL:

- ALL agent dialogue MUST use format: "Name (Role): dialogue"
- Example: Bob (Scrum Master): "Let's begin..."
- Example: {user_name} (Project Lead): [User responds]
- Create natural back-and-forth with user actively participating
- Show disagreements, diverse perspectives, authentic team dynamics
  </critical>

- Identify where developers struggled or made mistakes
- Note unexpected complexity or gotchas discovered
- Record technical decisions that didn't work out as planned
- Track where estimates were way off (too high or too low)

**Review Feedback Patterns:**

- Look for "## Review", "## Code Review", "## SM Review", "## Scrum Master Review" sections
- Identify recurring feedback themes across stories
- Note which types of issues came up repeatedly
- Track quality concerns or architectural misalignments
- Document praise or exemplary work called out in reviews

**Lessons Learned:**

- Look for "## Lessons Learned", "## Retrospective Notes", "## Takeaways" sections within stories
- Extract explicit lessons documented during development
- Identify "aha moments" or breakthroughs
- Note what would be done differently
- Track successful experiments or approaches

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Look for "## Technical Debt", "## TODO", "## Known Issues", "## Future Work" sections
- Document shortcuts taken and why
- Track debt items that affect next epic
- Note severity and priority of debt items

**Testing and Quality Insights:**

- Look for "## Testing", "## QA Notes", "## Test Results" sections
- Note testing challenges or surprises
- Track bug patterns or regression issues
- Document test coverage gaps

<action>Synthesize patterns across all stories:</action>

**Common Struggles:**

- Identify issues that appeared in 2+ stories (e.g., "3 out of 5 stories had API authentication issues")
- Note areas where team consistently struggled
- Track where complexity was underestimated

**Recurring Review Feedback:**

- Identify feedback themes (e.g., "Error handling was flagged in every review")
- Note quality patterns (positive and negative)
- Track areas where team improved over the course of epic

**Breakthrough Moments:**

- Document key discoveries (e.g., "Story 3 discovered the caching pattern we used for rest of epic")
- Note when team velocity improved dramatically
- Track innovative solutions worth repeating

**Velocity Patterns:**

- Calculate average completion time per story
- Note velocity trends (e.g., "First 2 stories took 3x longer than estimated")
- Identify which types of stories went faster/slower

**Team Collaboration Highlights:**

- Note moments of excellent collaboration mentioned in stories
- Track where pair programming or mob programming was effective
- Document effective problem-solving sessions

<action>Store this synthesis - these patterns will drive the retrospective discussion</action>

    **Lessons Applied:**
    - For each lesson from Epic {{prev_epic_num}}, check if team applied it in Epic {{epic_number}}
    - Look for evidence in dev notes, review feedback, or outcomes
    - Document successes and missed opportunities

    **Process Improvements Effectiveness:**
    - For each process change agreed to in Epic {{prev_epic_num}}, assess if it helped
    - Did the change improve velocity, quality, or team satisfaction?

    **Technical Debt Status:**
    - For each debt item from Epic {{prev_epic_num}}, check if it was addressed
    - Did unaddressed debt cause problems in Epic {{epic_number}}?

Charlie (Senior Dev): "I'll add to that - the caching strategy we implemented in Story {{breakthrough_story_num}} was a game-changer. We cut API calls by 60% and it set the pattern for the rest of the epic."

Dana (QA Engineer): "From my side, testing went smoother than usual. The dev team's documentation was way better this epic - actually usable test plans!"

Charlie (Senior Dev): _defensive_ "Hold on - I wrote those migration docs, and they were perfectly clear. The issue was that the requirements kept changing mid-story!"

Alice (Product Owner): _frustrated_ "That's not fair, Charlie. We only clarified requirements once, and that was because the technical team didn't ask the right questions during planning!"
