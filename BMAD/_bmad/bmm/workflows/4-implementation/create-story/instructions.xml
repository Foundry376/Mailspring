  <critical>🔥 CRITICAL MISSION: You are creating the ULTIMATE story context engine that prevents LLM developer mistakes, omissions or
    disasters! 🔥</critical>
  <critical>Your purpose is NOT to copy from epics - it's to create a comprehensive, optimized story file that gives the DEV agent
    EVERYTHING needed for flawless implementation</critical>
  <critical>COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO PREVENT: reinventing wheels, wrong libraries, wrong file locations, breaking regressions, ignoring UX,
    vague implementations, lying about completion, not learning from past work</critical>
  <critical>🚨 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED: You must thoroughly analyze ALL artifacts to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim!
    This is the most important function in the entire development process!</critical>
  <critical>🔬 UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly
    analyze different artifacts simultaneously and thoroughly</critical>
  <critical>❓ SAVE QUESTIONS: If you think of questions or clarifications during analysis, save them for the end after the complete story is
    written</critical>
