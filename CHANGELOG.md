### 1.7.8 (5/24/2020)

**Fixes:**

- Resolves a critical SMTP connection problem on Linux for Office365, manually configured Gmail, and other accounts that used the LOGIN SMTP authentication mechanism. #1996, https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-sasl/pull/613

- Plain text messages using a multipart MIME structure with one or more attachments now render correctly as plaintext.

- "Sync Mail Now" is displayed in Preferences > Shortcuts so it's easier to map it to a custom shortcut. #1941

**Developer:**

- Mailspring now uses CSS properties on `mailspring-workspace` to set the height of the thread list and other key components so themes can customize them! See #2004 for details and thanks to @sergeystoma for this improvement!

### 1.7.7 (5/20/2020)

**Fixes:**

- Mailspring now ships with OpenSSL-1.1.0f on Windows and Linux, which resolves connection issues with Yahoo and other IMAP providers that recently began requiring newer SSL / TLS features. #1974

- When testing IMAP auth, mailcore and libetpan debug logs are included in the "Detailed Log" output, which will make the above easier to track down in the future. #1974

- On Windows, pasting CRLF delimited plain text does not result in newlines being lost. #1756

- Mailspring no longer fails to connect to SMTP servers on older Linux distros (Ubuntu 14, etc.) that do not have `realpath` installed. #1974

- Groups of more than 999 contacts no longer cause “sqlite too many variables” errors during contact sync. #1951

- Google token expiration via password reset is handled properly and presents as an authentication error and not a connection error.

- When replying to plain email using the rich editor, quoted plaintext is converted to HTML #1853

**Developer:**

- On Windows, we ship the mailsync pdb files so stack traces viewed in the sync logs have function names for easy reporting / triage.

- Contact and calendar sync issues no longer halt email sync under any circumstances. We will continue to improve the quality of calendar sync, but want to ensure an uninterrutped email experience.

### 1.7.6 (4/21/2020)

**Fixes:**

- When re-authenticating existing from Preferences > Accounts, Mailspring no longer gets stuck displaying the settings window in some scenarios.

- When applying templates in the composer, Mailspring correctly clears the styling of the first line of your draft.

- When switching signatures in the composer, Mailspring no longer mangles your draft content in some scenarios.

- In the composer, `Select-all` + `Delete` no longer fails to delete your text if the very last block of your message is your signature.

- In the composer, undoing past the end of your "undo history" no longer removes focus from the editor.

- Mailspring now autolinks URLs that contain multiple `?` in the query string correctly.

- Mailspring uses relative URLs for it's own assets, so the filesystem path to the application can safely contain characters like `#` and `?` safely. #1366

- When messages must scroll horizontally, we add 20px to the computed height to account for the scrollbar and avoid clipping the last line of text. #1762

- Fixes an occasional issue that could cause the people sidebar to become blank if the user's LinkedIn handle was malformed. #1909

- A new button in Preferences > Accounts allows you to quickly retrieve + copy the last ~50 lines of your sync logs, making it much easier to collect information we need for debugging.

### 1.7.5 (4/16/2020)

**Features:**

- Search now supports the `NOT` operator as long as there is a positive search term. (ex: `in:inbox NOT is:unread`) #1605

**Fixes:**

- A major issue has been resolved that prevented IMAP accounts (including Yahoo, Yandex, etc.) from being connected correctly. I'm sorry it's taken so long for this patch to be released. Thanks to @Kozzi11 for the fix and everyone for helping to track down the bug. #1868

- Disabling image autoloading now works consistently and also prevents requests for external stylesheets and web fonts that could be used for tracking.

- Mailspring no longer gets "stuck" creating all drafts and replies in plaintext in some cases. #1894

- Localizations have been improved for Simplified Chinese and Russian (Thanks @anthonywong, @raven-kg), and @dvomaks added a Ukranian translation! All three have been added to the "verified localizations" list so they're easier to find in the language dropdown.

- If your machine's hostname contains spaces, Mailspring will strip them when identifying itself to SMTP servers to avoid being rejected in some cases. If it cannot determine your hostname it will fall back to your IP address similar to how Thunderbird works. #1808

- Deleting a "Found in Mail" contact from a CardDAV account (Fastmail, etc.) no longer causes sync to crash. #1722

- On Linux, Mailspring now depends on python2 for Ubuntu 20.

- On Linux, Mailspring's lists itself as a "Mail Client" rather than saying "Mailspring Mailspring" (Thanks @@SaeedBaig)

- When downloading attachments, Mailspring will not overwrite files in the selected folder and will choose unique names for attachments with the same name. #1901

- The LinkedIn URLs in the contact sidebar no longer contain duplicate `in/in/` fragments in some cases. #1875

- In the composer, lines containing a single space or starting with a single space are now preserved upon sending. #1874

- Sent mail reminders look better in the ui-dark theme and returning to the reminders view after clearing the last reminder no longer causes a crash. #689

### 1.7.4 (2/24/2020)

**Features:**

- Mailspring has been approved for read-write access to the Google People API and you can now manage contacts in Google accounts! Mailspring will ask you to go to Preferences > Accounts and click "Re-authorize" to grant access to this additional permission before editing contacts.

- We no longer use `is-online` and DNS checks to verify that the app is online. Instead, Mailspring checks that it can reach your actual IMAP / SMTP mail servers. #1357, #1731, #1123

- Mailspring now supports plaintext mail display and composition! It can be enabled via a new setting, or for a single draft by holding Alt/Option when creating it. Most composer features are disabled in ths mode - for more information, check out https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/issues/52#issuecomment-588627578.

**Fixes:**

- Mailspring now prompts you to confirm that you'd like to delete folders and labels. #1785

- When pasting a table from Excel or other forms of HTML that use `<style>` tags, Mailspring inlines the CSS and preserves it better in your message. #1773

- Adding and removing accounts no longer dismisses the app's preferences. #1684

- The performance of the composer has been greatly improved when there are a large number of recipients.

- The "Never Translate German" dialog and other modals no longer freeze the app on some platforms #1685

- Mailspring no longer crashes with a concurrency issue in some scenarios trying to launch sync on Linux.

- Scheduling reminders, etc. across the DST boundary now works properly in Brazil, which stopped using DST in 2019. #1767

- The default shortcut for deleting an empty draft is now Ctrl/Cmd + Escape, which works within the text editor. #1776

- Mailspring's email address autolinking no longer includes some UTF-8 control characters (most notably &nbsp;) in the email address link. #1796

**Misc:**

- You can now type IMAP configurations with a port number that starts with a default (eg: 2525 for SMTP). #1702

- You can now select text in the contact sidebar (URLs, bios, addresses, etc.) to copy/paste it.

- Preferences > Shortcuts is now split into two columns on wide displays.

- Mailspring is now automatically notorized for macOS Catalina

### 1.7.3 (2/24/2020)

The 1.7.3 release was broken because of Apple's February 2020 changes to macOS codesigning / "hardened runtime" requirements.

### 1.7.2 (10/22/2019)

**Fixes:**

- Resolves some scenarios that caused calendar and contact sync to crash during service autodiscovery, unnecessarily stopping email sync.

- You can now add Instagram handles to your email signatures (Thanks @piotrzarycki!)

- When switching layout modes, Mailspring clears the selection to avoid an immediate mark-as-read #1679

- On macOS, you can now use the Ctrl key as a modifier for shortcuts defined from the Preferences > Shortcuts screen. (#1678)

- The app's licenses file can now be viewed on Windows.

### 1.7.1 (10/14/2019)

This is small patch release addressing #1659 (conversation list gets stuck in the "loading state") and #1660 (mailsync crashes when syncing some Google Apps for Business account).

### 1.7.0 (10/13/2019)

Features:

**Incoming Message Translation**: Mailspring now offers to translate emails you receive in other languages. When you choose to translate an email, Mailspring sends the text of the message to a translation service (currently Yandex) and displays the result. Free users can translate up to 50 messages a week - Mailspring Pro removes the limit and allows you to "Automatically Translate" all messages in particular languages.

- Note: We're waiting on Google to approve Mailspring for access to the "Read-write Contacts" Oauth scope, so Gmail accounts will be read-only until ~December 2019.

**Contact Management**: Mailspring now includes a full-featured address book available from the `Window` menu! You can create, update, and delete contacts and contact groups in connected Google and CardDAV-compatible accounts (iCloud, FastMail and others.) Mailspring also allows you to turn off automatic suggestions based on your sent mail, and delete individual contact suggestions. When composing an email, you can now type the name of a group to insert all of the contacts in that group as recipients.

Fixes:

- Mailspring now displays unread mail notifications reliably, fixing a race-condition that occurred when new messages were synced too fast. #1467

- You can now re-order your email acccounts via drag and drop in Preferences > Accounts. #1577

- Mailspring always displays non-inline image attachments as files in the composer. Previously they looked identical to inline images. #1653

- The French, Slovenian, Portuguese, German, Tamil, and Chinese translations have been improved. (Thanks struk3lj, @matheusreich, @danopz, @Cortys , @mpetitjean, @singer233, and @lizzards!)

- Mailspring does a better job removing quoted text formatted by very old versions of Outlook.

- Mailspring no longer freezes when you type a link with a "#" (hash character) and then press return.

- On Linux and Windows, the system tray no longer turns blue whenever the app's window is hidden. #1467, #1017

- A new option in Preferences > General allows you to disable the shortening of recipient names. #515, #505

- A new option in Preferences > General allows you to expand message headers by default. #1521 #1525

- Mailspring's icon now appears square in the Windows Start menu.

- You can now dismiss Mailspring's upgrade prompt on Linux. #1514, #913

- Social links in Mailspring's sidebar now properly contain the www. prefix when required. #1559

- You can now type date shorthands (eg: "2d" or "2w") into the snooze date picker. #1621

Developer:

- On Debian Linux, we suggest rather than require gnomekeyring #998

- The (broken) plugin template has been removed - the starter for a Mailspring plugin is now located at https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Plugin-Starter #1645

### 1.6.3 (7/1/2019)

Fixes:

- Drag and drop of files into the composer and drag and drop of threads into folders / labels in the left sidebar now works as expected in all cases. #1533, #1534

- When typing in Japanese or another language that uses composition events / IME, the composer now always commits your text when the composition dropdown is dismissed. #1531

- A small "download" icon on the event header displayed in calendar emails allows you to download the underlying ICS file. #1547

- Resolves top issues reported via our automated error collection, including several problems causing instability in the composer.

- Right clicking an image or file attachment now gives you contextual menu options to save, open or preview the file. #1548

- You can no longer select a Label as your Gmail "Trash" folder. This was the root cause of several crashes and is not really conceptually supported by Gmail.

- Mailspring now warns when loading plugins that have not been compiled to JavaScript ahead of time. (We no longer ship TypeScript + Babel because relying on a specific verison is problematic and they are 30+ MB)

### 1.6.2 (6/18/2019)

Highlights:

- Mailspring now allows you to RSVP to calendar events directly from your inbox. Messages with .ics attachments or text/calendar mime-parts are displayed in a nice expanded format. The Calendar preview is back and more features are coming soon!

- A new menu option, "Copy Mailbox Permalink", allows you to generate a `mailspring://` URL for a thread. Clicking this link from another application opens the thread in Mailspring. Note: this is separate from thread sharing (public links) and only works on computers with the account synced.

- The composer is faster, more reliable, and uses significantly less RAM over time thanks to a new version of the SlateJS text editor. You can also drag and drop selected text and drag/copy/paste inline images. #1446, #578, #727, #773, #950, #1211, #1437

Improvements:

- The message viewer and the composer now stretch the full width of their panels by default. To get the old behavior back, enable "Restrict width of messages to maximize readability." in Preferences > General. #251

- Mailspring now supports snapcraft on Wayland properly. #1517 - thanks @e3b0c442!

- In dark themes, copy-pasting text out of an email into the composer will no longer transfer the text color if it's the theme default. #1053, #1309, #641, #1290

- The "Attach File" button has moved from the right to the left side of the composer's bottom bar, making it less likely that you'll tap the "Delete Draft" icon by accident. #1508

- Open tracking now correctly filters out your own tracking pixels so viewing emails doesn't trigger notifications. (This was a regression in a recent release.) #1494

- The "has: attachment" query now works when combined with other queries and search strings. #1480

- Sender name validation ("Are you sure you want to send addressed to 'Ben'?") now supports hyphenated names correctly. #1445

- On Linux, Mailspring handles icon themes without context keys properly. #1467

- The Dutch and Czech translations have been improved - thanks @mathiasbosman and @stepa0648!

- Mailspring displays a confirmation dialog before resetting accounts and settings. #1486 - thanks @joaolongo!

- Mailspring now warns if a permission error prevents it from updating it's macOS launch-on-start settings. #1493

- Incoming attachments without names are now given default names with file extensions inferred from their content type. #1487

- Mailspring no longer displays some HTML messages with specific styles at a height of 0px. #1496

- The color picker in the composer now includes a thin border so it's easier to see in all themes. #645

- When copy-pasting out of the composer into a plain text destination, newlines and whitespace are preserved in your text and composer copy paste is generally more reliable. #1457, #803

- Creating a signature with a `<style>` tag in it no longer applies the styles to the entire application window - style elements are now converted to inline styles in signatures. #964

- On Windows, the font dropdowns in the composer no longer appear white-on-white in dark themes. #1500

- Select-all and copy paste of email message contents now works reliably in all cases.

Development:

- Mailspring now uses Electron 4.2.4, which includes several security patches and minor bug fixes.

- Resizing Mailspring's main window is considerably faster thanks to better use of ResizeObserver.

### 1.6.1 (4/4/2019)

Fixes:

- Sync Mail Now now has a keyboard shortcut (F5). Thanks @StarScape!

- Swipe-to-archive on a macOS trackpad is less "touchy" and ignores interactions that are primarily vertical. #690

- Mail Rules run on every incoming message and always run after the message body has been fetched, fixing issues with some mail rules not being executed properly. #605, #513

- The "Check for Updates" menu item no longer causes the app to crash when no update is available.

- Fixes a regression in removing quoted text via the small "X" that appears over the quoted text marker. #1434

- Update snapcraft.yml to include gtk-3-themes #1435

- Spellcheck on large emails with more than 500 distinct words is much more performant thanks to a larger cache.

- In the composer, you can delete a text selection that includes the first character in the email. (More composer fixes are coming soon - we've been unblocked upstream in SlateJS!)

- The Japanese translation has been improved. Thanks @kometchtech!

- The Russian translation has been improved. Thanks @ivan-nginx!

- Mailspring now uses Electron 4.1.4, which fixes several crashes and an issue on KDE where tray icons would be displayed incorrectly as a 22x22 square cropped from the center.

### 1.6.0 (3/18/2019)

**Mailspring now uses the TypeScript compiler instead of Babel, and the entire project (92,000 LOC!) has been converted to TypeScript. 🎉** This took an enormous amount of effort - 9,800 TypeScript errors were resolved by hand - but will make the project more stable, easier to maintain, and easier to contribute to in the future.

- The German translation has been improved (Thanks @ahahn94!) and Japanese is now listed as a fully reviewed language!

- The Linux system tray icon is now larger and brighter when unread, which looks better on most Linux distros. (#1386)

- Mailspring now shows it's icon in notifications and correctly resolves the icon from your current theme is only supported for Gnome, Mate and Budgie. (Thanks @arkraft!)

- When clicking the track of a scrollbar, the view is scrolled by one page up or down rather than scrolling to the clicked position.

- When switching between a mailbox and "Drafts" or "Activity" the left sidebar no longer scrolls back to the top.

- Preferences styling has been slightly improved.

- Mailspring now uses Electron 4.0.8 which includes a recent security patch and is recommended for all users.

- Window controls are no longer “squished” in the darkside theme on Linux #1104

- Double-clicking the window toolbar on macOS correctly maximizes / unmaximizes the window. #1388

- When using the Outlook keybindings, Ctrl-F is no longer tied to both "Forward" and "Find in thread". "Find in thread" has been changed to Ctrl-Shift-F for consistency with Outlook.

- Mailspring strips surrounding quotes from displayed contact namess. #1397

### 1.5.7 (2/25/2019)

Fixes:

- Emails in Gmail accounts no longer "flicker" in the thread list occasionally if you mark them as read and archive them in quick succession.

- Duplicate sent emails (your copy + the recipient's copy) no longer appear in Gmail when open/link tracking are enabled. Gmail IMAP changed handling of IMAP Delete + Expunge in Sent Mail earlier this month causing this bug. This also resolves issues where viewing a message you sent would trigger read receipts. #1279 #1086 #937 #1162 #1049

- Mailspring no longer erases all your account passwords when signing out of your Mailspring ID on macOS due to a race condition.

- Cut/copy/paste and undo/redo now work in the "Create a Mailspring ID" and "Upgrade to Pro" webviews within the app. #15219

- Mailspring now requests the "internal / received" date of emails to handle providers (including home.pl) which do not return message dates when asked for mailbox headers. This fixes an important issue where all emails could appear to be from 1969.

- Mailspring now renders inline images attachments within the body of the email even if they're missing an "inline" content-disposition. Previously these images would appear as attachments at the bottom of the message.

- Mailspring now supports home.pl accounts which advertised support for the IMAP XLIST extension but did not appear to implement it properly.

- The contact sidebar now opens LinkedIn person profiles correctly - the "/in/" segment of the URL was previously missing.

- The signature editor now allows you to add a link to your LinkedIn profile.

- Mailspring shows the "Snoozed" folder name correctly in cases where it's called "Mailspring.Snoozed".

- Mailspring is now less aggressive about wrapping wide emails and prefers horizontal scrolling
  for large tables, etc.

- French translations have been improved (thanks to @Gaspacchio!)

Performance:

- Mailspring now uses DOM ResizeObservers to implement scroll bars and properly size emails as they render which is a huge performance win, especially on slower machines.

- Mailspring refreshes the data backing the conversation view asynchronously when threads are removed, eliminating jank that was especially noticable if you'd scrolled down in the list and were viewing a unified mailbox.

Development:

- Mailspring now uses Electron 4.0.5.

### 1.5.6 (2/8/2019)

Features:

- Mailspring now generates quick attachment previews of common "code" file types using Prism, including .html, .json, .txt, .log.

- Italian, Japanese and French translations have been improved (Thanks to @kometchtech, @ecavicc and @gooodmorningopenstack!)

Fixes:

- Mailspring now configures Yandex email accounts on custom domains correctly. #1337

- Emails that use `<style>` tags and `class` attributes without any inline styles are now rendered correctly.

- Selecting several lines of pasted text and enabling "Code Block" formatting now works correctly. #1346

- Maispring now plays the "New Mail" sound correctly even if you haven't interacted with the window since the app was launched. (This was broken due to a recent new feature in Chromium blocking web pages from playing audio.)

Development:

- Mailspring now uses Electron 4.0.4 which fixes several memory leaks.

- A preview of Mailspring's upcoming Calendar feature is available under the Developer menu. Right now, it only supports Google Calendar and the data shown on the calendar is read-only. Stay tuned! The UI was originally developed for Nylas Mail before it was shuttered and we'll be re-launching it this summer.

### 1.5.5 (1/3/2019)

Features:

- Mailspring now shows visual previews of PDF, DOCX, XLSX, XLS, CSV, and Markdown attachments on Windows and Linux as well as macOS. Selecting an attachment in the message view and pressing the space bar or clicking the small "eye" icon shows a preview of the contents in a new window.

Fixes:

- Mailspring no longer crashes with a fatal error on CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.6 with a "CXXABI_1.3.9" message. When we upgraded to Electron 4, using GCC++5 to build parts of Mailspring resulted in libraries too new for some linux platforms.

- In dark mode, text in message bodies is no longer black.

- The `copy` and `cut` context menu items are disabled when right-clicking a password field.

- The Brazillian Portuguese translation has been improved (Thanks @leoescarpellin!)

- You can now view Mailspring's open source license and all of it's dependencies' licenses and copyright notices from the menu.

### 1.5.4 (12/29/2018)

Improvements:

- An important bug that caused Mailspring to occasionally send blank or incomplete drafts (especially long relies or messages with significant quoted text) has been resolved! #948

- Printing email messages now works reliably and a new "Save as PDF" option in the print window makes it easy to export an email thread. #1236 #1027

- Extremely long messages now clip in the message panel and a "popout" option allows you to view their entire text in a separate window, similar to Gmail. This allows Mailspring to more reliably maintain good performance as you browse your email.

- A Brazillian Portuguese translation has been added (Thanks @leoescarpellin!)

- Russian and Japanese translations have been improved (Thanks @kometchtech, @TiiRiiX)

- Mailspring now runs on **Electron 4**. This should fix the menu bar not appearing in Ubuntu 18.10 (#1258, #1158) and comes with a long list of bug fixes and improvements (Mailspring was previously on Electron 2.0.14.) _As of this release, Mailspring and Electron no longer support macOS 10.9._

- The `has:attachment` search filter has been added. Note that this clause only returns messages Mailspring has downloaded and has "seen" the attachments for. (Currently the last three months of mail.) #1260

Fixes:

- Sending emails with consecutive whitespaces now works as expected. #1270

- Mailspring now adds itself to the Dock in macOS Mavericks properly. #1256

- The `Send and Archive` option is no longer shown when you're composing a new message. #980

- Mailspring no longer hangs when trying to sync a mailbox containing a message with an unidentified MIME part. #1266

- Mailspring no longer inserts an extra whitespace when you compose a reply with a default signature. #1264

- The tool tip displayed when scrolling in the message panel is now localized correctly.

- Copy / paste and the Terms / Privacy links in billing and registration windows now work properly. #1280

- Open tracking pixels now display as `Sent from Mailspring` when the recipient's email client shows image alt text. It's important we have alt text identifying the image in some way for highest deliverability, but the previous `open tracking` alt text was a bit too revealing for many users.

### 1.5.3 (11/25/2018)

Improvements:

- French and Japanese localizations have been improved. (Thanks @kometchtech, @shyne99!)

- Mailspring now honors "Do Not Disturb" on macOS and "Quiet Time" on Windows. Notifications do not appear and the "new mail" sound does not play.

- Mailspring is more stable and handles a variety of edge cases better thanks to crash reports from Sentry.

- Right-clicking an image and choosing "Copy Image" now works correctly on Linux.

- Mailspring's Outlook keyboard shortcut preset now includes Ctrl-Q for "mark as read" and many other shortcuts. On Windows, Alt-F4 quits the program rather than the non-standard Ctrl-Q.

Development:

- Mailspring now uses it's own logo API rather than Clearbit's, since we cannot provide appropriate Clearbit attribution when the logo images are used in email signatures.

- Mailspring now ships with Electron 2.0.14, which fixes a variety of small issues. We will move to Electron 4.x as soon as electron/electron#14260 is resolved.

### 1.5.2 (11/6/2018)

Improvements:

- Mailspring now defaults to English for languages whose translations have not been manually reviewed by a contributor. You can customize the interface language via a new setting in Preferences > General.

- Hundreds of translations have been manually reviewed and refined in German, Chinese, French and Korean. (Thanks to @pandanonyme @jungin500 @qitar888 @DarkSmile92!)

- When connecting a Yahoo Mail account, Mailspring notes that Yahoo requires an App Password. Provider-specific notes are also included in the "View Log" text for easier debugging.

- You can now change the "Sender Identity" (the name that is sent in the From field with your email address) for each account in Preferences > Accounts. #1169

Fixes:

- Mailspring no longer aggressively autocompletes :10 to the :100 emoji, or :12 to the :1234 emoji, to avoid conflicts with typing times. #1148

- On macOS, Mailspring's spellchecker correctly transitions to the language you're typing in consistent with Linux and Windows.

- The Emoji picker now works correctly when using Mailspring in a language other than English. #1189

- Shrinking Mailspring's UI using the "inteface zoom" setting no longer causes spellchecking "squiggles" to become invisible.

- The "Does Not Contain" mail rule now requires that every item in the field not contain the text as expected, rather than just requiring that any one of the items (senders, recipients, etc.) not contain the text. #1110

- Mailspring's "Upgrade to Pro" modal no longer appears badly clipped when using a custom interface zoom level.

- The fixed size "Add an Account" window now ignores custom zoom levels so that fields and forms are not clipped.

### 1.5.1 (10/27/2018)

Improvements:

- Thousands of translations have been improved or manually reviewed. Thanks to @odie2 @pamo @SimonVanacco @louim @DarkSmile92 @phylophyl and @renfliu for help in 6 languages!

- Mailspring now ships Linux appdata files (Thanks @kirbyfan64!)

Fixes:

- Reverts a change to IMAP message parsing that was designed to extend support for Proton Mail Bridge,
  which caused many emails from some IMAP servers to appear to be from "NIL".

### 1.5.0 (10/22/2018)

Features:

- Mailspring now supports localization! The app detects your system locale and all text, menus, buttons, etc. in the app appear in your language. Mailspring's core strings has been manually localized in 38 languages and the rest (mostly error messages and text describing features) have been automatically translated.

  - We'd love your help improving these localizations! A new "Developer > Toggle Localizer Tools" menu option in Mailspring allows you to submit better translations right within the app. You can also edit the translation files directly and submit a pull request. See the new [localizer guide here](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/LOCALIZATION.md).

  - If you use a RTL language, Mailspring's entire UI now appears right-justified, including the sidebar, preference panels, scrollbars, and more. If you use Mailspring in Arabic or Hebrew and notice issues in the right-to-left presentation, please file issues or submit pull requests.

Fixes:

- The "contact profiles" feature of Mailspring Pro is much more robust and reliable thanks to a new profile discovery mechanism.

- The "contact profile" sidebar shows the Gravatar associated with the email address before falling back to the "empty box with initials".

- Mailspring 1.3 brings an overhauled search bar with powerful autocomplete that makes it easier to create advanced search queries.

  - In addition to searching for freeform text and using the Gmail query language (`subject:`, `in:`, `is:`, `from:`, `to:`), Mailspring now allows you to search by date using natural language terms like `since: "last week"` and `before: "february 5th"`. Try combining them with other terms to search a specific time window!

- In the Taiga theme, the selected item in dropdown menus is visible. #674

### 1.1.3 (2/6/2018)

Improvements:

- When adding an IMAP account, Mailspring now uses the domain's MX records to identify if it can use settings for a common email service to skip the full, complicated IMAP settings screen.

- When adding a Gmail account, Mailspring now uses two-legged OAuth instead of three-legged OAuth which allows it to renew it's access token more rapidly. (Re-authenticate Gmail accounts for this to take effect.)

- Mailspring `VACUUM`'s the SQLite database every two weeks to prevent fragmentation that can eventually ruin performance. Unfortunately, data cannot be read or written during this process and it can take ~2 minutes for a 3GB database, so it is performed at launch with a new progress screen.

- When sending an email, the word "attachments" in your signature will no longer cause the app to complain about missing attachments. #610

- Mailspring no longer attempts to create the folder `Mailspring..Snoozed` on providers that include the path delimiter in the IMAP namespace prefix. #634

- When composing an email, Mailspring will display an alert if you need to choose a Drafts folder to send mail. #634

- Mailspring now uses Electron 1.8.2-beta5, which includes stability and security fixes.

Developer:

- Mailspring now stores user preferences in the appropriate platform-specific location: `Library/Application Support` on the Mac, `AppData/Roaming` on Windows, etc.

- `NylasEnv` is now known as `AppEnv` and `nylas-exports` and `nylas-component-kit` have been renamed `mailspring-*`. Additionally, packages need to specify `"engines": {"mailspring":"*"}` instead of listing `nylas`.

- Much more of Mailspring has been converted to ES2016, and CoffeeScript is no longer supported for plugin development. The CoffeeScript interpreter will be removed in a future version. Please use ES2016 JavaScript instead.

- Mailspring now uses `Prettier` — before submitting pull requests, ensure `npm run lint` is clean, or add a Prettier plugin to your text editor. (It's awesome!)

- A plugin browser / "store" is coming soon - stay tuned!

Privacy:

- Mailspring does not send your email credentials to the cloud. Features like Snooze, Send Later, and Send Reminders now run on your computer. Future versions may re-introduce the option to run these features in the cloud.
